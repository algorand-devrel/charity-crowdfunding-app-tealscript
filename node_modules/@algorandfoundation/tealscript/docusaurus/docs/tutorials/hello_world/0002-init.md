# Algokit Init

To get started, run the following Algokit command to initialize a template:

```bash
$ algokit init --template tealscript --name hello_world
```

For this tutorial, I have chosen the name `hello_world` for my project, which will be reflected throughout the rest of this content. If you choose a different name, some parts might be different for you.

## Template Layout

After the init command finishes, you should have the following directory structure:

```
.
├── README.md
├── __test__
│   └── hello_world.test.ts
├── contracts
│   ├── artifacts
│   │   └── components
│   ├── clients
│   └── hello_world.algo.ts
├── jest.config.js
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

If you have experience with web development, most of this should look familiar. Below are the key directory and files

### __test__/
#### hello_world.test.ts

`hello_world.test.ts` is a test for our contract written with Jest. This tutorial won't go too in-depth into testing, but it is a good example on how client-side contract interaction works

### contracts/

#### hello_world.algo.ts

`hello_world.algo.ts` is the most important file in the template. This is where our contract logic is defined. You might notice that this file has a `.ts` extension, but also an `.algo.ts`. The `.algo.` is there solely to help tools like ESLint and TypeScript differentiate between regular TypeScript files and TEALScript files. The TEALScript compiler does not require the `.algo.ts` extension but it is highly recommended to use. Any files without `.algo.ts` extension in this template may be mistaken for TypeScript files that should be compiled into JavaScript (instead of TEAL), which may cause errors.

#### artifacts/

`artifacts/` is the directory where all the files generated by the TEALScript compiler and algokit will go. We will go further in-depth on these artifacts in the next step of this tutorial.
