 * Runs the given indexer call until a 404 error is no longer returned.
 * Tried every 200ms up to 20 times.
 * Very rudimentary implementation designed for automated testing.
 * @example ```typescript
 * const transaction = await runWhenIndexerCaughtUp(() => indexer.lookupTransactionByID(txnId).do())
 * ```
 * @param run The code to run
 * @returns The result (as a promise), or throws if the indexer didn't catch up in time
